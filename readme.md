# Four in a Row - board game

This is a two-player connection board game,
in which the players choose a color and then
take turns dropping colored tokens into a seven-column,
six-row vertically suspended grid.
The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest
available space within the column.
The objective of the game is to be the first to
form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of
four of one's own tokens.
